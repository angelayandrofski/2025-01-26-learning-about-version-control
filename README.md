# Learning about Version Control
Author: Angela Yandrofski

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it! 

What I like most about version control is that I can always go back to a previous working version if I tried out 
something new that doesn't work. What I find the most frustrating is having to remember to pull the changes from the
remote version control repository even though I've already made changes to my local version control repository.
